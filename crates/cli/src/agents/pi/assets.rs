//! `crates/cli/assets/pi-extension` is the npm workspace package and the one copy of

//! crates.io, and Cargo packages only files under the crate root.
//!
//! Only what pi loads is embedded: manifest, entry point, shared modules and the
//! standalone transport. The managed bundle in `crates/cli/src/daemon/managed` embeds
//! the same shared modules behind its own entry point.
